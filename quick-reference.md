## EMERGENCY ANSWERS TO COMMON QUESTIONS

**"Which should I buy?"**  
→ Start with what you liked tonight! Each has its purpose.

**"How do I store bourbon at home?"**  
→ Store upright, away from sunlight. Doesn't age in bottle (unlike wine).

**"Is ice okay?"**  
→ Absolutely! Try it both ways and find your preference.

**"Are expensive bourbons better?"**  
→ Not always. Buffalo Trace is affordable and exceptional. Blind tastings often surprise people.

**"Can I visit these distilleries?"**  
→ Yes! Most offer tours. Kentucky Bourbon Trail is amazing.

**"Why does bourbon taste like vanilla?"**  
→ Charred oak barrels! Charring caramelizes wood sugars, creating vanilla compounds.

**"What's the difference between bourbon and whiskey?"**  
→ All bourbon is whiskey, but not all whiskey is bourbon. Bourbon has specific legal requirements (51% corn, new barrels, made in USA).
