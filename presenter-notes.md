## Bourbon Basics (Slides 3-5) | 10 minutes

### Slide 3: What Makes Bourbon "Bourbon"?
**Key Teaching Moments:**
- Emphasize that bourbon is a **legally defined** spirit with specific requirements
- Fun fact: "Only 5% of bourbon is made outside Kentucky, but it can be made anywhere in the USA"
- The "new charred oak barrel" requirement is why bourbon barrels can only be used once (they then go to Scotland, Ireland, Mexico for scotch, whiskey, tequila aging)

**Engagement:**
- Ask: "Who thought bourbon had to be made in Kentucky?" (Most will raise hands)
- Explain the corn requirement: "That 51% corn is what gives bourbon its characteristic sweetness"

### Slide 4: The Art of Tasting
**Demonstrate Each Step:**
1. **Visual:** Hold glass up to light, swirl gently, observe color
2. **Nose:** Important technique - start with glass below nose, gradually raise it
   - "If you stick your nose right in the glass, the alcohol will overwhelm everything"
   - "Take short, gentle sniffs rather than one big inhale"
3. **Palate:** Take a small sip, let it coat your tongue
   - "Don't swallow immediately—let it sit for a moment"
   - "Try to move it around your mouth—different areas of your tongue detect different flavors"
4. **Finish:** After swallowing, breathe out gently through your nose
   - "Notice what flavors linger and how long they last"

**Pro Tip to Share:**
- "Adding water isn't 'cheating'—it's actually a professional technique. A few drops can open up the bourbon and release aromatics that were trapped by the alcohol."

### Slide 5: Pairing Principles
**Make It Relatable:**
- Compare to wine pairing (but note bourbon's higher alcohol means different rules)
- **Complement example:** "Sweet with sweet—like honey and tea"
- **Contrast example:** "Salty pretzels with sweet caramel bourbon—the contrast makes both more interesting"
- **Fat principle:** "Think of how a buttery croissant can tame even the spiciest food"

**Set Up the Evening:**
- "Tonight, we have a variety of pairings available. I encourage you to experiment—try unexpected combinations. You might discover something amazing!"

## BOURBON 1: High West (Slides 6-10) | 15 minutes

### Slide 6: Introduction
**Opening Hook:**
- "We're starting our journey in an unexpected place—not Kentucky, but the mountains of Utah."
- "High West is Utah's first legal distillery since 1870, and they're doing something really interesting..."

**Key Facts to Emphasize:**
- Founded in 2007 (relatively young in bourbon world)
- Park City location—world's only ski-in distillery
- This is a **blended** bourbon (explain what that means)

### Slide 7: History & Mission
**Tell the Story:**
- "Founded by a biochemist who fell in love with whiskey"
- "The blending philosophy: it's not about cutting costs, it's about creating something greater than the sum of its parts"
- "Like a chef combining ingredients to create a dish, they blend bourbons of different ages to achieve the perfect balance"

**The Conservation Angle:**
- "They donate 10% of profits from American Prairie to conservation—so you're literally drinking for a good cause!"
- Shows commitment to American heritage beyond just whiskey

### Slide 8: Profile
**Technical Details:**
- Aged 2-13 years (it's a BLEND of different ages)
- "The youngest component gives freshness and brightness, the oldest gives depth and complexity"
- 92 proof = 46% ABV (explain proof = 2x alcohol percentage)

**Mash Bill Explanation:**
- 75% corn (sweeter, softer)
- 21% rye (spice, pepper)
- 4% malted barley (enzymes for fermentation, adds grainy character)

### Slide 9: Tasting Notes
**Lead the Tasting:**
1. **Visual:** "Notice the lighter amber color—that tells us about the blend"
2. **Nose:** "What do you smell? Common notes include..."
   - Guide them to vanilla, caramel, citrus
   - "Some people get candy corn—that's the sweet corn coming through"
3. **Palate:** "Take a small sip..."
   - "Notice the sweetness up front?"
   - "That honey nougat character is really distinctive"
4. **Finish:** "How long do the flavors last?"
   - "That pecan pie note at the end—that's from the oak aging"

**Encourage Discussion:**
- "What flavors are you getting? Everyone's palate is different."
- Validate all responses—there are no wrong answers

### Slide 10: Food Pairings
**Interactive Moment:**
- Hand out or point to the recommended pairings
- "Try the dark chocolate with this one..."
- Walk them through WHY it works: "The caramel notes in the bourbon echo the caramelization in the chocolate"

**Pairings to Highlight:**
- **Dark Chocolate:** "The best combo tonight—trust me"
- **Salted Almonds:** "The nuts bring out that honey nougat character"
- **Chocolate Croissants:** "If you have these, it's heaven"

**Give Time:** Let guests try pairings, discuss, ask questions (3-4 minutes)

## BOURBON 2: Basil Hayden (Slides 11-15) | 15 minutes

### Slide 11: Introduction
**Transition:**
- "Now we're heading to Kentucky, to a bourbon with a Revolutionary War-era story..."
- "This one is very different from what we just tasted—notice the lighter body"

**Set Expectations:**
- "Basil Hayden is 80 proof—the lightest we'll taste tonight"
- "But don't let that fool you—it's got a distinctive kick"
- "This is what we call a 'high rye' bourbon"

### Slide 12: The Man Behind the Name
**Tell a Story:**
- "Meredith Basil Hayden Sr. was a farmer who brought Maryland rye traditions to Kentucky frontier"
- "In 1796, he did something radical—he increased the rye content in his bourbon"
- "This created an entirely new style. He's literally called the 'Father of High Rye Bourbon'"

**Make It Personal:**
- "Imagine being on the frontier, experimenting with your whiskey recipe, not knowing if it would work..."
- "That's the pioneering spirit that built the bourbon industry"

### Slide 13: Profile
**Technical Deep Dive:**
- **27% rye** is HIGH (typical bourbon might be 10-15%)
- "More rye = more spice, more pepper, less sweetness"
- Jim Beam Small Batch Collection (explain Small Batch = limited barrels, more attention)

**The "Artfully Aged" Label:**
- "They used to label this '8 years old'"
- "Now they blend different ages, so they can't claim a specific age"
- "This gives them more flexibility to maintain consistent flavor"

### Slide 14: Tasting Notes
**Lead the Tasting:**
1. **Nose:** "Right away, you'll notice this is different"
   - "That charred oak is much more prominent"
   - "There's still vanilla and caramel, but they're in the background"
2. **Palate:** "Here comes the spice..."
   - "That black pepper note is the high rye at work"
   - "Notice how it's light-bodied but flavorful?"
3. **Finish:** "Clean, dry, peppery"
   - "Very different from the sweet finish of High West"

**Compare to First Bourbon:**
- "Notice how different these are? High West was sweet and approachable, this is spicy and bold"
- "That's the beauty of bourbon—incredible diversity"

### Slide 15: Food Pairings
**The Savory Bourbon:**
- "Because of that spice and pepper, this pairs beautifully with savory, rich foods"
- "While High West was your dessert bourbon, this is your meat and cheese bourbon"

**Pairings to Highlight:**
- **Beef Jerky:** "The spice complements the smoke and cure"
- **Charcuterie/Salted Meats:** "The fat coats your palate and tames that pepper"
- **Aged Cheese:** "Sharp cheddar is perfect—both have that bold character"

**Tasting Tip:**
- "If the pepper is too much, add a tiny bit of water—watch how it softens"

**Give Time:** Let guests explore savory pairings (3-4 minutes)

## BOURBON 3: Buffalo Trace (Slides 16-20) | 15 minutes

### Slide 16: Introduction
**Build Anticipation:**
- "Now we're going to the world's most award-winning distillery..."
- "Buffalo Trace represents over 200 years of American whiskey-making tradition"
- "This is bourbon royalty"

**Key Points:**
- Oldest continuously operating distillery (since 1775!)
- 90 proof—back up from the 80 proof
- Aged minimum 8 years (that's substantial)

### Slide 17: Historic Legacy
**Timeline is Impressive:**
- "1775—the year of the Revolutionary War"
- "This distillery has survived wars, Prohibition, economic depressions"
- "The fact that it's still making bourbon today is remarkable"

**The Name Story:**
- "Buffalo Trace refers to an ancient buffalo migration route"
- "For centuries, buffalo herds would cross the Kentucky River at this exact spot"
- "The distillery literally sits on a path worn by thousands of buffalo"
- "That's American history right there in your glass"

### Slide 18: Craftsmanship
**The Traditional Process:**
- Cypress wood fermentation tanks (very traditional, rare today)
- Copper pot stills (affects flavor development)
- **8 year minimum aging** is significant
  - "Most bourbon is 4-6 years"
  - "8 years means more interaction with the wood"
  - "Kentucky's extreme seasons—hot summers, cold winters—drive bourbon in and out of the wood, extracting flavor and color"

**What This Means for Flavor:**
- "More time in wood = deeper color, more oak influence, more complexity"
- "But also requires skill—too long and it becomes bitter"

### Slide 19: Tasting Notes
**Lead the Tasting:**
1. **Visual:** "Look at that deep amber color"
   - "Compare to the previous two—significantly darker"
   - "That's the 8+ years at work"
2. **Nose:** "Rich, smoky notes"
   - "This has gravitas—it demands your attention"
   - "You'll get caramel, vanilla, but there's also this wonderful oak/smoke character"
3. **Palate:** "Bold and warming"
   - "Notice the weight of this compared to Basil Hayden?"
   - "That toffee note is beautiful"
   - "Robust spice but balanced with sweetness"
4. **Finish:** "Long and warming"
   - "The mark of quality bourbon is a long finish"
   - "Notice how the flavors just keep evolving?"

**Discuss Complexity:**
- "This is what 'complexity' means in bourbon—layers of flavor that reveal themselves over time"
- "You could sip this for an hour and keep discovering new things"

### Slide 20: Food Pairings
**The Versatile One:**
- "Buffalo Trace can handle both sweet and salty because it's so well-balanced"
- "The bold character means it won't be overwhelmed"

**Pairings to Highlight:**
- **Kettle Corn:** "Sweet and salty—perfect contrast"
- **Salted Pretzels:** "Brings out that toffee character"
- **Chocolate Espresso Beans:** "Bold meets bold—both the coffee and bourbon can shine"

**Experimentation:**
- "This is a good one to try with multiple pairings"
- "See how different foods bring out different aspects of the same bourbon"

**Give Time:** Encourage multiple pairing experiments (4-5 minutes)

## BOURBON 4: Maker's Mark (Slides 21-26) | 15 minutes

### Slide 21: Introduction
**The Grand Finale:**

- "The distinctive square bottle with hand-dipped red wax"
- "And a revolutionary recipe that changed bourbon forever"

**Set the Stage:**
- "Founded 1953—relatively young compared to Buffalo Trace"
- "But what they did was revolutionary..."

### Slide 22: The Samuels Family Story
**Tell the Story with Drama:**
- "October 1, 1953: Bill Samuels Sr. buys a distillery for $35,000"
- "He comes from 11 generations of distillers"
- "But here's the thing—he wants to make bourbon HE actually enjoys drinking"
- "He looks at traditional bourbon and thinks: there must be a better way"

**The 1960s-70s Positioning:**
- "The tagline was: 'It tastes expensive... and is'"
- "They positioned it as a premium product when most bourbon was value-oriented"
- "That was gutsy—and it worked"

**National Historic Landmark:**
- "1980: First active distillery to receive this designation"
- "You can tour it today—it's beautiful"

### Slide 23: The Revolutionary Wheat Recipe
**The Big Innovation:**
- "Here's what makes Maker's Mark truly unique: wheat instead of rye"
- "Remember Basil Hayden with 27% rye? Very spicy, peppery"
- "Maker's Mark uses soft red winter wheat instead"
- "This was radical. Nobody was doing this."

**Explain the Impact:**
- "Rye gives you spice and bite"
- "Wheat gives you softness and sweetness"
- "The result: smooth, approachable, never bitter or sharp"
- "Created the 'wheated bourbon' category"

**Aged to Taste:**
- "Most distilleries age to a time: 6 years, 8 years, whatever"
- "Maker's Mark tastes every barrel and decides when it's ready"
- "Usually 6-7 years, but it varies"
- "That's attention to detail"

### Slide 24: Iconic Details

**Square Bottle:**
- "Cognac-style square bottle"
- "Premium positioning—stands out on the shelf"

**'Whisky' Spelling:**
- "Notice: W-H-I-S-K-Y with no 'E'"

- "Most American whiskey has the 'E'"
- "Small detail, but meaningful"

**Share this as Brand Story:**
- "This is a family that thought about every detail"
- "That care extends to what's inside the bottle"

### Slide 25: Tasting Notes
**Lead the Final Tasting:**
1. **Visual:** "Medium amber—not as dark as Buffalo Trace"
   - "That 6-7 year aging sweet spot"
2. **Character:** "The first word that comes to mind should be: smooth"
   - "This is the smoothest bourbon we've tasted tonight"
   - "That's the wheat at work"
3. **Flavors:** "Vanilla, caramel, gentle oak"
   - "Notice the ABSENCE of pepper and spice?"
   - "Front-of-palate sweetness—immediate and welcoming"
   - "That vanilla from the charred barrels is beautiful"
4. **Finish:** "Mellow, sweet, elegant"
   - "Not the long, bold finish of Buffalo Trace"
   - "But refined, composed, sophisticated"

**Compare to the Others:**
- "Think about our journey: High West sweet & complex, Basil Hayden spicy & light, Buffalo Trace bold & smoky, Maker's Mark smooth & refined"
- "Each has its place, its purpose, its fans"

### Slide 26: Food Pairings

- "Away from direct sunlight"
- "Once opened, it's good for years if stored properly"

- Might add a cocktail component—show how each bourbon works in an Old Fashioned

---

## Emergency/Backup Plans

### If a bourbon runs out:
- "No problem—that means it was popular!"
- Focus on the remaining three, spend more time on pairing experiments

### If someone doesn't like bourbon:
- "That's completely fine—bourbon isn't for everyone"
- Have non-alcoholic options available
- "The learning still applies to any spirit"

### If timing runs long:
- Combination slides can be shortened
- Focus on the bourbons themselves over pairing deep-dives

### If timing runs short:
- Extend pairing experimentation time
- Do a more elaborate Q&A
- Discuss bourbon cocktails (Old Fashioned, Manhattan, Mint Julep)
