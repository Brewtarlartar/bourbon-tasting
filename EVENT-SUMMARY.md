## 🎓 BOURBON EDUCATION KEY POINTS

### What Makes Bourbon Special:
1. Must be made in USA
2. At least 51% corn (gives sweetness)
3. Aged in NEW charred oak barrels (creates vanilla/caramel)
4. No additives allowed (pure spirit)
5. Legal requirements ensure quality

### Why Food Pairings Matter:
1. **Fat reduces burn** - coats palate, tames alcohol
2. **Salt highlights sweetness** - emphasizes caramel/vanilla
3. **Sweet balances spice** - counteracts peppery rye
4. **Contrast creates discovery** - opposite flavors surprise
5. **Complement creates harmony** - similar flavors enhance

### The Tasting Journey:
- **Start lightest** (Basil Hayden at 80 proof)
- **Build complexity** (Maker's Mark, Buffalo Trace)
- **End boldest** (High West at 92 proof)
- This prevents palate fatigue and lets each bourbon shine
